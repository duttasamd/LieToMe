Cave digging is the practice of enlarging undiscovered cave openings to allow entry.
Cave digging usually follows a search of mountains and valleys in karst topography for new caves.
Often it takes place underground in places where a large passage has clearly been backfilled with silt, or choked with boulders.
Sometimes chisels or explosives can be used to widen constrictions in the passage when spaces are evident on the other side.

In electricity generation, a generator[1] is a device that converts motive power (mechanical energy) into electrical power for use in an external circuit.
